Custom nice theme for the TextMate TODO bundle
===========================

TextMate ships with an awesome TODO bundle feature to help you track your project todos, bugs or whatever you would like to keep track of. Yeah it's awesome... BUT the default themes just sucks :) So if you're like me and you can't stand using awesome but ugly tools... here's the double rainbow all aver the way yeah. Your sad TODO bundle eyes wait for that litle shine of happyness for too long... make it happy, make it sexy :D

## Installation guide: 

Grab/download the _lightGray directory and copy and paste it into:
/Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Support/themes/

Then open up a file in TextMate and hit ctrl+shift+t (or go to Bundles > TODO). Now that you have the TODO window open you'll find a little select menu in the top right corner, just select your new theme, wait a second and you're all set!

If you would like to change the theme name, you'll have to choose and change the directory name and then you'll have to also change any occurence of the old name inside the style.css file.

## You can't find where to put the theme? 

Go into your Applications directory, find the TextMate app, right clik on it and click "Show package content", then go throw Content > SharedSupport > Support > themes, and juste copy and paste the _lightGray directory you just grabbed before doing all of this.

Then open up a file in TextMate and hit ctrl+shift+t (or go to Bundles > TODO). Now that you have the TODO window open you'll find a little select menu in the top right corner, just select your new theme, wait a second and you're all set!
